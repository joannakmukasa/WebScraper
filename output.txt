Esteemed Clients,

I am delighted to introduce the FY2021/2022 edition of the URA Client Service Charter. This edition underscores our dedication to delivering exceptional service that aligns with our core values of Patriotism, Integrity, and Professionalism.

The Ugandan economy has witnessed significant growth in recent years, resulting in an increase in potential taxpayers. However, the tax-to-GDP ratio in Uganda has yet to reach its full potential. There is a considerable endeavor ahead to free Uganda from economic dependency and elevate the tax-to-GDP ratio to 20.9% through intensified domestic revenue generation.

Recognizing the willingness of many potential taxpayers to fulfil their tax responsibilities, it becomes our responsibility at URA to enhance compliance. This Charter serves as a foundation for our clients to hold us accountable for our commitments and offer constructive feedback, thus contributing to the realization of the aforementioned URA mandate. - John Rujoki Musinguzi, Commissioner General
